Hospitals often face challenges in managing patient admissions, discharges, and associated costs efficiently. Manual processes and disparate data systems lead to inefficiencies, errors, and increased costs. To address these issues, there is a need for a comprehensive hospital dashboard solution that can centralize admission and discharge data, provide real-time insights into patient flow, and facilitate cost analysis. This project aims to develop a robust hospital dashboard that enhances operational efficiency, optimizes resource allocation, and improves overall patient care quality.
